# Dinner: The Game

Dinner: The Game is my response to Exercise 36 of [_Learn Python the Hard Way_](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). So far, it is a tiny stub of a game that doesn't do anything.

The overarching plan is to create a short adventure game where a player, through mysterious means, enters series of short dungeons and fights randomly generated monsters.
