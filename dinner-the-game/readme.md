# Dinner: The Game

Dinner: The Game is my response to Exercise 36 of [_Learn Python the Hard Way_](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). So far, it is a tiny stub of a game and needs to be run locally, which you can do by doing the following:

1. Make sure you have Python 2 installed (you do if you're on a Mac). If you don't, you can [install it through various means](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download dinner.py.
3. Open Terminal or your Terminal equivalent.
4. `cd` to where you downloaded dinner.py.
5. Run `python dinner.py` in the Terminal.
6. Enjoy!
