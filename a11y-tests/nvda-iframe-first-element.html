		<h1>NVDA <code>iframe</code> first element test</h1>

		<p><a href="#">Stop link</a></p>

		<p>Tested with <strong>Firefox 41.0</strong> and <strong>NVDA 2015.3</strong> on <strong>Windows 7</strong>, to see how iframes behave when accessed as the first element on the page.</p>

		<p>The iframe output:</p>

		<code>
			&lt;iframe title="This is the iframe title attribute" src="http://simplyaccessible.com" width="420" height="300"&gt;<br>
		  	&lt;p&gt;Here is a text fallback for the iframe, with &lt;a href="http://simplyaccessible.com"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
			&lt;/iframe&gt;
		</code>

		<h2>On page load (browse mode)</h2>

			<q>NVDA iframe test busy iframe banner landmark navigation landmark button open menu...</q>

			<p>NVDA identifies the iframe, says it is busy as it accesses the iframe content, identifies the iframe again, then begins reading the iframe content from top to bottom as it would read from the top of the page normally. It does not read the <code>title</code> of the iframe content.</p>

		<h2>Shift + M (browse mode)</h2>

			<p>NVDA reads: <q>This is the iframe title attribute iframe banner landmark navigation landmark open menu button</q> when accessed from further down the page.</p>

			<p>NVDA reads the iframe's <code>title</code> attribute, identifies the iframe, drills down through any ARIA role information, and reads the first element in the iframe. It does not read the <code>title</code> of the iframe content.</p>

		<h2>Tab (browse mode)</h2>

			<p>From the top of the page, pressing tab sends focus to the whole page and reads <q>NVDA iframe test document button open menu</q>. Although focus wasn't visibly moved to the button itself but to the page, interacting with the button that is read works. If focus is moved back to this tab stop with Shift + Tab, nothing is read.<p>

			<p>Pressing Tab twice from the top of the page sends focus to the iframe container and no content is read, but pressing Enter or space interacts with the first element in the iframe, a button, although it does not have visible focus. Pressing Shift + Tab to move back to this tab stop does not read anything.</p>

			<p>Pressing Tab three times sends focus to the first focusable element in the iframe but does not read it. Pressing Shift + Tab back to this tab stop reads the element.</p>

			<p>If NVDA is automatically reading content from the top of the page on load and the Tab key is pressed, focus moves as expected to the next focusable element after the element currently being read.</p>

		<h2>Tab (forms mode)</h2>

			<p>NVDA reads: <q>This is the iframe title attribute iframe this is the iframe title attribute document</q></p>

			<p>NVDA reads the iframe's <code>title</code> attribute, identifies the iframe, speaks the iframe's <code>title</code> attribute a second time, then identifies the content of the iframe as a document. It does not read the <code>title</code> of the iframe content.</p>

    <h2>Recommendation</h2>

      <p>NVDA identifies iframes and iframe content differently depending on how users navigate to the iframe. In the case of loading an iframe as the first element on the page, iframes present particular challenges to users who are attempting to navigate via elements that recieve keyboard focus, such as skip navigation, global navigation. Since users will have different experiences based on how they access the content and users relying on the Tab key will have particularly inconsistent experiences, refraining from using iframes in general is recommended. </p>
